## Use Case covered

This project demonstrates a handwritten digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The use case covered is:

- **Digit Recognition from a Whiteboard** â€“ Users can draw a number on a Tkinter-based whiteboard, and the trained model will predict the digit in real-time.
This showcases how deep learning can be applied to handwritten text recognition, which is widely used in applications like OCR (Optical Character Recognition), banking systems, and automated form processing.
